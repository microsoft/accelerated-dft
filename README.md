# Project

Accelerated DFT is a cloud-native, GPU-accelerated DFT program for molecular systems engineered by Microsoft offered through [Azure Quantum Elements](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum-elements/product-overview). 

This repository contains benchmarking data and sample inputs for Accelerated DFT as detailed in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11185).

- [benchmarks](./benchmarks)
  - Geometries of 329 molecules comprising the test set (geometries.tar.gz)
  - Accelerated-DFT input files and settings used to run calculations on the test set [input_spe-m062x.ipynb](./benchmarks/input_spe-m062x.ipynb) , [input_spe-wb97x.ipynb](./benchmarks/input_spe-wb97x.ipynb)
  - Accelerated-DFT output files for the test set using both M06-2X and wB97x functionals  (m062x_results.tar.gz , wb97x_results.tar.gz)

- [samples](./samples)
  - single point energy example input [spe.ipynb](./samples/bomd.ipynb)
  - single point force example input [spf.ipynb](./samples/bomd.ipynb)
  - geometry optimization example input [go.ipynb](./samples/bomd.ipynb)
  - full Hessian example input [fh.ipynb](./samples/bomd.ipynb)
  - Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics example input [bomd.ipynb](./samples/bomd.ipynb)

The samples included in this project are for reference only. You need an active Accelerated DFT service (which supplies you the access key) to run the samples. 

If you are interested in trying out Accelerated DFT, please [sign up](https://smt.microsoft.com/en-US/AQEPrivatePreviewSignup/) for private preview of Azure Quantum Elements.
