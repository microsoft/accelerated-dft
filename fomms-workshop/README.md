# Instructions

Create a Codespace from this repository, we will submit calculations using the Codespace (if you have difficulties ask an instructor for help). 
Alternatively, if you prefer working on your laptop, create a python environment using the environment file provided `conda env create -f ./fomms-workshop/environment.yml`

## Examples
We will run Accelerated DFT in the notebooks provided, these show some of the tasks and properties that can be computed with Accelerated DFT. All molecules and analysis tools required are also provided.
Together, we will run the following examples:     

1-FOMMS_spe.ipynb ('spe' single point energy calculation)

2-FOMMS_go.ipynb ('go' geometry optimization)

3-FOMMS_fh_IR.ipynb ('fh' full hessian calculation)

To run these examples, use the 'connection string' provided to you and insert in the appropriate cell in the notebook. This allows you to connect to the Accelerated DFT service.


These examples may be run after the workshop and adapted for you to explore functionality:

E-FOMMS_go_ts.ipynb

E-FOMMS_spe_FL172.ipynb

Further examples are provided in the Accelerated-DFT repository /samples
