# Instructions

Create a Codespace from this repository, we will submit calculations using the Codespace. 
Alternatively, if you prefer working on your laptop, create a python environment using the environment file provided `conda env create -f ./fomms-workshop/environment.yml`

## Examples
We will run Accelerated DFT in the notebooks provided, these show some of the tasks and properties that can be computed with Accelerated DFT.    
We will run the following examples:     

1-FOMMS_spe.ipynb ('spe' single point energy calculation)

2-FOMMS_go.ipynb ('go' geometry optimization)

3-FOMMS_fh_IR.ipynb ('fh' full hessian calculation)

These examples may be run after the workshop and adapted for you to explore functionality:    
E-FOMMS_go_ts.ipynb

E-FOMMS_spe_FL172.ipynb
